It's a thrill of your kiss that started all this
And like never before I'm begging for more
Whenever the music starts to fill the air I reach for you and you are there
Here in my arms again I hold you near suddenly it's oh so clear
That love has finally come my way
I find that my heart begin to skip a beat I guess it knows my life's complete
Since I saw those dreamy eyes soon begin to realize
That love has finally come my way
Oh the thrill of your kiss that started all this
And like never before I'm begging for more
Oh I never thought that love could be so wonderful but look at me
When I start to get that certain glow I want the whole wide world to know
That love has finally come my way
Oh the thrill of your kiss...
Yes love has finally come my way
