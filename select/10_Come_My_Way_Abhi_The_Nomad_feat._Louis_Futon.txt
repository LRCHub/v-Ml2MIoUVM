I'll take my chances like it's Vegas
Go roll the dice, and try my hands at being famous
Might be for me
Don't switch up plans until we make it
I'll slow it down, I call that "cinematic pacing"
Catch up to speed
And if you wanna ride, you can ride with us
But if you don't want to fly, then that's fine with us
Oh yeah
You can just call my name
You want this shit? Then come, come my way
I ain't missed once in all my days
Oh, come my way
Baby, just call my name
You want to get rich? Come, come my way
I ain't missed once in all my days
Oh, come my way, like (Way)
Come my way
Come my way
They say, "You fake it 'til you make it"
Oh baby girl, there ain't no trick to being patient
Might work for you, won't work for me
I take my chances and believe that they'll catch up to speed
And if you wanna ride, you can ride with us
But if you don't want to fly, then that's fine with us
Oh yeah
You can just call my name
You want this shit? Then come, come my way
I ain't missed once in all my days
Oh, come my way
Baby, just call my name
You want to get rich? Come, come my way
I ain't missed once in all my days
Oh, come my way, like (Way)
Come my way (Way, way)
Come my way
