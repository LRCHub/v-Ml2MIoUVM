Someone said today
That you're gonna be coming my way
Don't know what to do
Except get ready to say
I miss you, I need you

Well, I know that it's wrong
That you been away so long
It's been lonely at night
Especially when I hear our song
I love you.

So come my way
If you wanna be by my side

Well, I been told you care
And that you were leaving there
Well, I'll be waiting here
And I will say a prayer
To get you, to keep you

Well, if you're passing through
There's one thing I wish you would do
Tell me that you're mine
And I'll be loving you, loving you.

If you wanna be by my side

Tell me how you feel about me, girl
You're the prettiest girl in the world, I'd say
Let me hold you in my arms, a girl
She's the prettiest girl, oh yeah yeah yeah

Well, someone said today
That you're gonna be coming my way
Well, I hope that it's true
Cause I am ready to say I love you, I do

If you wanna be by my side
If you want to take a ride
Come my way.
